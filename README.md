# Kendo UI for Angular 2 Proof of Concept â€” Northwind Dashboard

The goal of this project is to build a dashboard application with the following set of technologies:

* Angular 2
* NativeScript
* Kendo UI for Angular 2
* The [Kendo Bootstrap Theme](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-bootstrap)

It includes a web interface and a set of two mobile applications for iOS and Android.

## Goals

- Sharing business logic through services
- Consistency in the data binding for web and mobile
- Consistent looks that share a common color scheme through the Bootstrap Sass variables
